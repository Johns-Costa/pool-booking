| Name          | Database Key  | Field Type    | Validation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Name      | name     | CharField     |  max_length=50, unique=True    |
| Description         | description         | TextField    | null=True   |
| Canceled    | canceled    | BooleanField     | default=False    |

8. **Booking**

Created to allow the booking of classes

| Name          | Database Key  | Field Type     | Validation |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| User          | user          | ForeignKey     | User,on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, blank=True           |
| Description   | description   | CharField      | max_length=50 |
| Date          | date_time     | DateField      |     |

| Class         | selected_class| ForeignKey| Class, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, blank=True |


```Python
    # Time periods variations
    TIME_PERIODS = (
        (0, '9:00-9:45'),
        (1, '10:00-10:45'),
        (2, '11:00-11:45'),
